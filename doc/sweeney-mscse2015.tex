% Documentation for University of Washington thesis LaTeX document class
% by Jim Fox

%
%    Revised for version 2014/11/13 of uwthesis.cls
%
%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation
%       
%    % --- sample stuff only -----
%    special stuff for my document, but you don't need it in your thesis
%    % --- end-of-sample-stuff ---


%    Printed in twoside style now that that's allowed
%

\documentclass [12pt, proquest] {uwthesis}[2014/11/13]

%
% The following line would print the thesis in a postscript font 

% \usepackage{natbib}
% \def\bibpreamble{\protect\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}}

\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}  % Print the chapter and sections to the toc


% ==========   Local defs and mods

% --- sample stuff only -----
% These format the sample code in this document
